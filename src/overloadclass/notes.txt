MethodOverloading:
It's a mechanism in java that allows us to have same method name with different parameters.
Parameters can be different in number, type or sequence.
Why we should overload a method?
1)Method overloading allows us to reuse same method name over and over that we don't have to come up
with different method names.
2) it allows us to write clean code.

How to overload a method:
we can overload a method by redefining it with different parameters.



Mehtod Overriding:
It's a mechanism in java that allows a subclass or

Why we should override a method?

Syntax of override?
There must be aparent child relationship between two classes.

Rules:
1) To override a method there must be parent child relationship between two classes.
2) If something can't be inherited we can't override.
